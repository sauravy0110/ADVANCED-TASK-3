Project Overview: Fruits Prediction Using Deep Learning and Flask
Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to upload images of fruits (such as Apple, Banana, or Orange), and based on the image, the system will predict the type of fruit using a deep learning model. The web application will provide the predicted fruit name along with the prediction probabilities.

Key Features:
Image Upload and Prediction:

Users can upload an image of a fruit through a web interface.
The app processes the image and uses a trained deep learning model to predict the type of fruit (Apple, Banana, or Orange).
Deep Learning Model:

A deep learning model, likely based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is trained to classify fruit images.
The model is pre-trained on a dataset of fruit images (Apple, Banana, Orange) and is used to predict the fruit type from the uploaded image.
User Interface:

The front-end is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a simple and responsive user interface.
Users can easily upload an image, and the prediction results (fruit name and probabilities) are displayed.
Flask Web Framework:

Flask is used as the back-end web framework to handle HTTP requests, process the uploaded images, make predictions, and render the results.
The application runs locally or on a server, allowing users to interact with the prediction model via the web.
Model Evaluation and Visualization:

Once the prediction is made, the app displays the fruit name and the probability score.
The user interface shows the uploaded image alongside the prediction result, offering a clear and visual way to view the classification outcome.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsive web design and layout.
Flask templating engine (J

Project Overview: Fruits Prediction Using Deep Learning and Flask
Objective:
This project aims to build a web application that uses a deep learning model to classify fruit images. The user uploads a fruit image (such as Apple, Banana, or Orange), and the model predicts the type of fruit along with the prediction probabilities. The web app provides the prediction result and a visual display of the uploaded image.

Key Features:
Image Upload and Prediction:

The user can upload an image of a fruit (Apple, Banana, Orange) through a web form.
The uploaded image is processed and passed to the deep learning model for prediction.
Deep Learning Model:

A pre-trained deep learning model (such as a Convolutional Neural Network, CNN) is used for fruit classification.
The model is trained on a dataset of labeled fruit images, and it predicts the fruit type from the uploaded image.
User Interface:

A simple and responsive front-end is created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The interface allows users to easily upload an image and view the classification result (predicted fruit and probability).
Flask Web Framework:

Flask serves as the back-end framework to handle HTTP requests, load the model, preprocess the image, and provide predictions.
It facilitates interaction between the front-end and the model by rendering results dynamically.
Model Evaluation and Visualization:

After prediction, the web app displays the fruit name and classification probabilities.
The user can view the uploaded image and the prediction result on the same page.
Tech Stack:
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for building the web page.
Flask for rendering templates and handling web requests.
Backend:

Flask is used to handle file uploads, process images, make predictions using the deep learning model, and return the results.
Python is used for the image processing and model prediction logic.
Deep Learning Model:

A CNN-based model, trained using TensorFlow/Keras, is used to predict the fruit type.
The model is saved in .h5 format and loaded into the Flask app for inference.
Image Processing:

The PIL and TensorFlow libraries are used to load and preprocess images to match the input requirements of the deep learning model.
Deployment:

The application runs locally or can be deployed on a web server, providing an interface accessible via a browser for image uploads and predictions.
Workflow:
Model Training:

A CNN model is trained using a dataset of fruit images (Apple, Banana, and Orange).
The trained model is saved and later loaded into the Flask app for real-time prediction.
Web Application Development:

Frontend: A clean and user-friendly interface is created for uploading fruit images.
Backend: Flask is used to manage the logic of image processing and prediction.
Prediction Process:

Upon uploading an image, the system processes the image (resizing, normalization) and uses the trained model to predict the fruit type.
The predicted result and probability are displayed on the web page, along with the uploaded image.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be integrated with web development to build an intelligent system capable of classifying images. By combining TensorFlow and Flask, the app offers a seamless experience where users can easily upload images and receive instant predictions of the fruit type.
